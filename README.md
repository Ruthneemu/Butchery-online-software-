### üìö Tech Stack

This project is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. Below is a breakdown of each technology and its role in the Butchery Online Software project:

- **HTML**: Used for creating the structure and content of the web pages. It defines the elements on the page such as headers, footers, forms, buttons, and product listings, forming the backbone of the user interface.

- **CSS**: Responsible for styling the web pages to make them visually appealing. It is used to control the layout, colors, typography, and overall look of the site, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly design.

- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the website. It is used for tasks such as form validation, dynamically updating the shopping cart without reloading the page, and enabling smooth user interactions with elements like buttons, dropdowns, and modal dialogs.

- **PHP**: The server-side scripting language used for handling business logic. PHP processes user input, manages user authentication (e.g., for admin login), and communicates with the MySQL database to fetch, insert, and update data such as customer orders and product information.

- **SQL**: A query language used for managing the database. MySQL is used to store data related to customer orders, product inventory, user information, and order history. SQL queries allow the PHP backend to interact with the database by retrieving, updating, and deleting data as needed.
